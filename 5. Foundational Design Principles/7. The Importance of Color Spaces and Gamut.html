<p>Take a look at this picture of a view controller in storyboard. Can you see the smaller rectangle with a brighter red?</p><p><br></p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-09-14_21-02-41-b1b4ff2c79a9edfff19daa4198187e41.png"></figure><p>Believe it or not, the background rectangle and the smaller rectangle are actually the same color. They both have RGBA values of (red: 255, blue: 51, green: 27, alpha: 100) or a hex color of #FF331B. So why do they look different?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Color Space Affects The Way Colors are Displayed</strong></p><p> </p><p>The reason the two rectangles look different is that they have different color spaces (also referred to as color profiles or gamut). The smaller rectangle has the sRGBIE61966-2.1 color space and larger rectangle has a generic RGB color space. So it should be clear by now that <em>using the wrong color space in your apps can lead to inconsistencies with your app design plan</em>. </p><p>The issue here is that RGB color systems are device dependent. Color systems do not explicitly refer to one color: the RGBA color (red: 255, blue: 51, green: 27, alpha: 100) can refer to thousands of potential different colors. This is because the red, green, and blue component values are describing percentages <em>relative</em> to the hardware that the color is being displayed on. Different manufacturers use different shades of red, green and blue, and the manufacturing process can result in different maximums due to variations in dye choices, phosphorus usage, lighting components, and more. </p><p>So if the RGB color system has this problem surely HSB is fine, right? Well it has the same problem because it is basically a linear transform from RGB. And of course, we know that the HEX color system is just a different transcription of RGB so it too shares the same problem.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is a Color Space?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>A color space is simply a standardisation of device dependent color systems like RGB. Device independent color systems do exist such as LAB but these are not in Xcode at the moment. Therefore, we need to pay careful attention to the color space we are using. There are many supported color spaces in Xcode, so which one should you use?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The sRGB and P3 Color Space</strong></p><p><br></p><p>For most iOS app design work you only need to worry about the sRGB (more specifically the sRGBIE61966-2.1 color space) and P3 color spaces. The sRGB color space is the most common color space used both in iOS and on the web. It is the default color space that you export most of your work from the UI design tool called Sketch which we will be talking about later on in this course. Whenever you have issues with the look and feel of your colors in Xcode, this can sometimes be attributed to the color space falling back to the wrong color space. I have faced this issue before. All you need to do is click on the cog wheel in the color picker in Xcode and change the color space to your desired setting.</p><p><br></p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-09-14_22-17-39-8092151070e88b2102a2e741557c6469.png"></figure><p><br></p><p>P3 (abbreviation for Display P3) is a newer color space that simply supports a wider color gamut than sRGB thanks to advances in hardware. The P3 is supported on newer iPhones like the iPhone X. </p><p>Apple's Human Interface Guidelines encourages us to use sRGB and P3 specific colors and assets where appropriate to provide the best possible user experience:</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p><strong>Provide color space-specific image and color variations when the experience calls for it.</strong> In general, P3 colors and images tend to appear as expected on sRGB devices. Occasionally, however, it may be hard to differentiate between two very similar P3 colors when they're viewed in sRGB. Gradients that use colors in the P3 spectrum can also sometimes appear clipped on sRGB devices. To avoid these issues, you can provide distinct images and colors in the asset catalog of your Xcode project to ensure visual fidelity on both wide color and sRGB devices.</p></blockquote><p>We will be looking at how to do this in the next lecture however one thing to pick up from this is that even the app assets we supply to our apps are affected by color spaces. Images that we supply in our assets catalogs have an embedded color profile and we should ensure they match the correct color space.</p><p><br></p>

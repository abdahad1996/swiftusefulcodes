<p>Color systems (also known as color notations or color profiles) provide a way to describe colors in computer graphics. There are many systems that exist such as HSL, HSV, HSB, RGBA and so on. We will be focusing on RGBA, HSB, HEX, CYMK and GrayScale because these are the most relevant color systems in iOS app design. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is RGBA?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue and Alpha. From our lecture, "Choosing a Color Scheme", it should be obvious that Red, Green and Blue are primary colors. By mixing these colors in varying amounts you create other colors. It is important to understand at this stage that the mixing we are referring to is not the same as adding together colors like you would paint. When you create colors from mixing physical substances the result is <em>subtractive</em>. The mixing you get from RGBA is <em>additive</em> which is only possible with light. So when we say we are mixing, we are thinking of the color outcome you would get from blending (or superimposing) red, green and blue light beams. Alpha stands for the transparency of the color.</p><p><br></p><p>RGBA has three channels (the R, the G and the B) measured from 0 to 255. This corresponds to 16,777,216 possible colors (or 256 x 256 x 256). Alpha is a value from 0 to 100. The closer to 100 the alpha is the more opaque the color gets. The closer to 0 the alpha is the more transparent the color gets.</p><p>In iOS, we use the following UIColor initializer to create RGBA colors in Xcode:</p><p><code>UIColor(red: CGFloat, green: CGFloat, blue: CGFloat, alpha: CGFloat) </code> </p><p><br></p><p>However, in iOS we represent RGBA colors as normalized values. This means the actual RGBA values are expressed from 0 to 1 and we get this by dividing each RGBA value by 255. So for example, let's say we have an orange color with an rGBA(245, 166, 35, 100) as pictured below.</p><p><br></p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-09-14_17-48-02-598494f51070240671ecfe8571661b76.png"></figure><p>To represent this as an RGBA color in Xcode we would have to do this: </p><p><code>UIColor(red: 245 / 255, green: 166 / 255, blue: 35 / 255, alpha: 1.0)</code> </p><p><br></p><p>However, this is only important if you set the color programmatically. Things are different if you attempt to set RGBA colors in interface builder with the color picker or sliders. You set the real RGBA values without normalizing them.</p><p><br></p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-09-15_08-35-50-c2a7101fc25ad48f9c8c257ca297dc52.png"></figure><p><br></p><p><strong>What is HSB?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>HSB stands for Hue, Saturation and Blue. It is considered a human friendly way of describing color. Hue is a number between 0 and 360 which corresponds to the number of degrees in a circle. Hue represents where we are in the color wheel (N.B we covered the color wheel in our lecture "Choosing a Color Scheme"). The hue can be used to easily create color variations (for example, making a color variation by moving 20 degrees forwards or backwards in the color wheel).</p><p><br></p><figure><img height="587" src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-09-14_19-05-52-e6650ea3e53b525faa01ad6fd61e5a3e.png" width="587"></figure><p>Saturation represents how rich or how prominent a color is and it is a number between 0 and 100. A saturation of 100 represents the richest possible version of that color and 0 is the gray version. Simply changing the saturation can define how important a color is in the user interface.</p><p><br></p><p>Brightness is a number between 0 and 100 where 0 is black and 100 is white (only if the saturation is also 100). Changing brightness helps give darker shades of a color.</p><p><br></p><p>In iOS, we use the following UIColor intializer to create HSB colors in Xcode:</p><p><code>UIColor(hue: CGFloat, saturation: CGFloat, brightness: CGFloat, alpha: CGFloat)</code></p><p><br></p><p>Notice that we have an alpha with HSB in Xcode. Therefore, it is technically more correct to use the term HSBA and not HSB although these can be used interchangeably. Alpha of course represents how transparent the color is.</p><p><br></p><p>Just like RGBA colors, HSB values are expressed between 0 and 1. Below is the same orange but this time expressed in HSB.</p><p><br></p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-09-14_19-25-55-d2346b9f58acd1c7bedd0cf74e645ed4.png"></figure><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>To express this in Xcode, we need to do this:</p><p><code>UIColor(hue: 37 / 360, green: 86 / 100, blue: 96 / 100, alpha: 1.0)</code></p><p><br></p><p>Just like RGBA, you only need to normalize HSB colors if you are setting them programmatically. In interface builder, you can set the real values.</p><p><br></p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-09-15_08-37-24-33d2f8bf239bbce6e0d0fba2c57455d0.png"></figure><p><br></p><p><strong>What is HEX?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>HEX stands for hexadecimal and as the name implies these are colors represented to the base 16. They are represented by 6 characters preceded by a hash (i.e #). The first two represent the red, the next two represent the green and the last two represent the blue. Here is the same orange but in hex notation:</p><p><br></p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-09-14_19-34-52-7a479e97065acae7dac6197f6cddd6ef.png"></figure><p>HEX is simply RGB written differently. So why would we use HEX? Well, HEX is a lot faster to write than RGBA. However, RGBA is favored where you need to control the alpha of a color. </p><p><br></p><p>Xcode has no UIColor initializer to create HEX colors programmatically. You can set a HEX color in interface builder but what should you do when you have setup your apps views programmatically? We will create an extension to UIColor that allows us to create HEX colors later on this course in the section CALayer and Gradients when we attempt to create a color mixing app. If you would like to see this extension now then check it out on <a href="https://gist.github.com/Gwinyai/3c7846682852862f6cb65b562d9023ab" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this gist</a>.

You cannot set CMYK colors programmatically in Xcode but you can using interface builder as the following picture shows.</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-09-15_08-54-34-385f8c648547c7cbbec0955c88c61c61.png"></figure><p><br></p><p>CMYK is a bit odd compared to the other color systems we have looked at because it is largely meant for print media. You see, RGBA is an excellent choice for computer screens and digital systems because these all emit light and RGBA is an additive color system which emulates the same behaviour as light. However, CMYK is a subtractive color system which means adding these colors has a color outcome similar to adding together inks and dyes. Physical materials like these selectively absorb light for example a red substance absorbs red wavelengths of light and a blue substance absorbs blue wavelengths of light. The light that is not absorbed in reflected which results in the intended color we end up seeing.</p><p>CMYK has four channels of color being Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Key. The Key or Black is there because the combination of the first three will never produce a fully saturated black on their own. The Key is also not the "True" black even at 100%. If "True" black where used in print it would rip most paper because of the amount of ink needed.  Each of these channels is  measured from 0 to 100%. When we use CYMK we look at each channel and think of the relative intensity of the ink we want to apply to create different hues of color.</p><p>One final important point about CYMK is that is has less colors than RGBA. CYMK has about 10 million color possibilities whereas RGBA has more than 16 million. This means you must take great care when you attempt to convert RGBA colors to CYMK. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is GrayScale?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>GrayScale cannot be set programmatically but it can be set in interface builder.</p><p><br></p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-09-15_09-35-13-d98ebf37bdcc2795d97871d8ecb3d499.png"></figure><p>You cannot set any colors with grayscale. It simply a range of monochromatic colors from black to white and  just represents different shades of gray in between. It only uses one value called brightness which controls how intense the different shades of gray are.</p>

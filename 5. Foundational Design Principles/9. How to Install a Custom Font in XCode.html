<p>This lecture is a reference. What we will learn here will not be included in our end of section test. If you are not yet familiar with Xcode then simply leave this lecture until you have covered at least half of Part 2 of this course.</p><p><strong>1. Download the Custom Font</strong></p><p><a href="https://fonts.google.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a> provides a large collection of free to use fonts. Xcode supports True Type Font (.ttf) and Open Type Font (.otf) font files which should be included in any font download from Google Fonts. If you are looking for font inspiration, you could try the <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WhatTheFont</a> service to detect the fonts used by your favourite apps. </p><p><br></p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-09-14_09-51-21-c854075619e9e82eff6edb5966b3ceea.png"></figure><p><br></p><p><strong>2. Import your Custom Font into XCode</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Create a new group in your Project Navigator called Resources (this is optional but it will keep your project neat and tidy). Now simply drag and drop your font files into the Resources folder and ensure that "Copy items if Needed" and "Add to Targets" are selected.</p><p><br></p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-09-14_10-13-49-951311f843baa7b259dc334d004de831.png"></figure><p><br></p><p>It should now be possible to see your font files in your Project Navigator under the group Resources. Click on any one of them and ensure that Target Membership is selected in the File Inspector on the right hand side of Xcode.</p><p><br></p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-09-14_10-18-57-0c9b71717abafa4b0553f2bb62da57e1.png"></figure><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Check that the Fonts Are Included in the Resource Bundle</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Now go to the "Build Phases" of your project by clicking on your Xcode Project at the top of the Project Navigator. Look for a section called "Copy Bundle Resources" and expand it. You should be able to see your font files listed.</p><p><br></p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-09-14_10-44-37-99313838427ed6ab802e10ce26730514.png"></figure><p><br></p><p><strong>4. Include Your Fonts in your Info.plist</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Now find your Info.plist in your Project Navigator and click it. Add a new key to your Info.plist called "Fonts provided by application". Now add the names of all the fonts under this key as an array. Use the name exactly as how it appears in your resources group. Ensure the "Target Membership" is selected for each font name you provide.</p><p><br></p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-09-14_10-58-22-de36b8500cdf4057d01dc93aaf088a26.png"></figure><p><br></p><p><strong>5. All Done. Check Everything Is Working</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Go to Storyboard and drag out a UILabel. Try change the font to your custom font in Attributes Inspector. If you can find your custom font then everything is working correctly. </p><p><br></p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-09-14_11-04-58-0de213b47bb75759830bf6ebfc5d8dd2.png"></figure><p><br></p><p>To use your custom font in code you will need to know its font name. This is not always obvious and might not match the file name. Run this code to get a list of all the font names in your app and try locate the font name of your custom font.</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">for family in UIFont.familyNames.sorted() {
        let names = UIFont.names(forFamilyName:family)
        print("Family: \(family) Font names: \(name)")
}</pre>

<p>By now, you have had some experience with the vector tool in Sketch and you probably already know it is based on the Bézier curve. But what is the Bezier curve? Where does it come from?  The Bézier curve is not unique to Sketch; you will find it in other graphic design tools and even in animation. In this short article, we will look at the origins of the Bézier curve and how it has transformed graphics design.</p><p>The Bezier curve gets its name from a French engineer by the name of Pierre Bézier. From 1933 to 1975, Bézier worked for the automobile company Renault. As part of his work on CAD (Computer Aided Design) Bézier popularised the use of a parametric curve that would go on to be called the Bézier curve. The Bézier curve greatly aided in creating smooth curves with incredible ease of computation, stability at lower degrees of control points and the ability to be translated and rotated by performing operations on its points. It's important however to note that Pierre Bézier popularised what is known as the Bézier curve but he did not actually invent it.</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-11-08_11-30-59-2991899a00fe64302df0efd090637bdc.jpg"></figure><p><strong><em>Pierre Bézier - Image Credit: Solid Modeling</em></strong></p><p>The exact origins of the Bézier curve is a bit complicated but it is generally agreed that the curves were first developed in 1959 by Paul de Casteljau using the De Casteljau algorithm. Paul de Casteljau was a French engineer working for an automobile company called Citroën. Both Pierre Bézier and Paul de Casteljau came up with the Bezier curve independently of each other although it was Paul de Casteljau who came up with it earlier. Due to Citroën's policies at the time, Paul de Casteljau was not able to publish his research which is why his contribution to the Bézier is not as widely known.</p><p>If you look back far enough, you will end up realising that the Bézier curve goes back decades before Pierre Bézier and Paul de Casteljau. The formulas for the Bézier curves coordinates are actually special cases of a more general formula called the Bernstein polynomials. The Bernstein polynomials were created by Russian mathematician Sergei Bernstein around 1910. </p><p>In all fairness, the development of the Bézier curve may be seen as a group effort. The Bernstein polynomials laid the foundation for the Bézier curve, Paul de Casteljau helped to created the curves and Pierre Bézier helped to make it all work with computer graphics. It is not unusual to hear some people refer to the  Bézier as the De Casteljau curve which is just a small attribution to De Casteljau's work. </p>

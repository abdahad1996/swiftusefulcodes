<p>Welcome to App Development. This part of the course covers how to build iOS apps from scratch! We also master how to use different iOS frameworks. These include Core Location to get user location, Core Data to save data and AVFoundation to record video. By the end of this section, you will be able to create your own fully fledged apps!</p><p>This entire segment also serves as preparation for Part 3 Custom Interface Development where we go a step further and master how to build custom UI components and animation. Part 3 is where we master UIKit, Core Graphics and Core Animation which are essential to converting some of the most complex app designs to real apps. Part 3 is really all about giving your app a little extra edge above all the rest on the App Store but you'll need Part 2 to give you a solid foundation in iOS app development first. </p><p><strong>If you are a complete beginner...</strong></p><p>It is essential you follow all the videos in this section in order starting from Beginner Swift. Nothing is optional because you need a good foundation in the various frameworks of iOS. Your first introduction into code might feel overwhelming and I would just like you to know that this is perfectly normal! Ask me any questions and I will help. </p><p><strong>If you are intermediate to advanced...</strong></p><p>Not everything in this section will be useful to you. If you already have some experience with building apps feel free to skip to any lectures in this section after the To-Do List App. However, Part 3 Custom Interface Development of this course assumes you have a good grasp of how to build iOS apps so if you feel a bit rusty use this section to revise. </p><p><strong>Keep Moving...</strong></p><p>You'll get stuck from time to time. That's fine. Just keep moving. Some concepts take longer to understand than others but the important thing is not to get frustrated. Often times, you'll meet the same concept in a different app but just in a different context where it is much easier to understand. </p><p><strong>Code Along with Me...</strong></p><p>This is considered best practice on learning how to code. Skimming over a video might feel okay but you are not actively involved in the code. Therefore, code the app as I do in the videos. Add comments to your code to remind you of the logic behind what you were building.</p><p><strong>Keep your completed projects safe...</strong></p><p>Keep your completed projects safely on your computer. You'll refer back to them to revise certain things. For example, you'll learn how to build the logic to keep your text fields visible in your app when the keyboard appears. The logic behind this is not something you cram. Neither is it something you will always remember how to do. Instead, you'll refer back to the project in which you got the text fields to remain visible when the keyboard appeared. Therefore, every project you create is part of your library of completed projects. Over time, you'll be able to recall code without referring to your library of completed projects.</p>

<p>Welcome to my favourite part of the course and congratulations for making it this far! This is where we make our apps truly extraordinary! At this point you should know how to build an app. Therefore, you should have completed Part 2 before you got here. If you only completed a fraction of Part 2 then be warned that I do not hold back in this part of the course. It starts easy but things eventually become deep.</p><p>In this segment of the course we will focus on custom interface development. This will be a critical part to bringing even complex app designs to code. Depending on the demands of our app design, we might need to create custom components that do not exist in iOS. We might need to create custom transitions, interactive views or even animations. We will be learning all this and more. </p><p>The three essential frameworks we will learn are UIKit, Core Graphics and Core Animation. All these form part of the iOS graphics stack. My major focus is on teaching you how to use these frameworks without the assistance of programs like Paint Code. I'm well aware they exist but trust me in the long run you'll want to know everything in detail first before you use these things. </p>

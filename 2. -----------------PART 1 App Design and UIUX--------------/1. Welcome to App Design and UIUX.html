<p>Welcome to this new section on App Design and UI/UX. Here are a few things you should know before you start.</p><p><strong>1. Slides are For Theory</strong></p><p>The vast majority of the content in this course will be code along and design along videos. But we will go through slides for theory. I know theory feels boring. But it’s necessary. It makes all the difference on how to tackle design challenges in real life. For example, the theory you learn on typography will affect the font style, line height and font size you choose in your mockups.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. Choose Sketch or Figma</strong></p><p>You need to learn at least one app design tool. If you are able to get Sketch then this will be your best option for this course. I’ve offered Figma if you can’t afford the price tag on Sketch. If you would like to master both Sketch and Figma then you are more than welcome! </p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. App Design Is Not Easy</strong></p><p>Making app icons and mockups won’t be easy if you are completely new to it. It takes time and practice. If you get stuck on a certain app icon, wireframe or mockup then skip the video and come back to it later. You’ll make better progress this way. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. Articles and Further Reading will Help You Go Further</strong></p><p>Articles and further reading links in this course are mostly optional but are designed to help you learn more. I’ve added them for the students in this course who really want to go deeper into topics.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. More Content Is Being Added!</strong></p><p>As time goes on, I'll be updating the course to reflect changes to app design tools but I'll also be adding any interesting new topics that pop up in the app design field. Stay tuned!</p>
